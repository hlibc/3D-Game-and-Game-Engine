--------------------------------

	This is a heavily modified package set organized by CM Graff.
	The texture set has been extensively audited to ensure that it 
	contains only completely free material which is compatible with 
	the MIT or zlib license. 


Original readme.txt:
--------------------

	This directory contains "packages" of textures and other materials
	for use with the engine, in their respective subdirectories.

	In most cases these are modified/selected sets by me(Oortmerson), 
	refer to the original readme's how to obtain the full sets, and 
	copyright / author information.
